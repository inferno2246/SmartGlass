# SmartGlass

A smart IOT device that uses just a NodeMCU and an OLED Display to become the smart glass.

All the notifications on your smartphone will be displayed directly on the glass installed on this device, and you won't
have to keep taking out your phone out of your pocket everytime.

A great device to use when in certain situations where it is not possible to take out your phone.

Feel free to share and test it!
